Description:

Shout is an web-based application that allows college students to post their comments and thoughts anonymously. Users are able to view posts from their specific university, and they have the option to upvote or downvote posts to affect their popularities and outreach. Navigation panels allow users to view the top posts of the week, the newest posts, and the most upvoted posts for all colleges. Each post has its individual thread where users are allowed to comment and discuss. This application is intended to be a medium for students to converse about the ongoing events on their campus without a fear of judgement or the need to directly socialize. 

Why Shout?

Yik Yak was an anonymous chat application that was highly popular on college campuses from 2014 until 2017, when it was shut down. Today with the censorship across Tumblr, Reddit, YouTube and other forms of social media, we propose a new alternative that allows for anonymous discussions with members of your local community. Shout is a new social media platform with the ideals of college students kept in mind. Our platform will be designed around the 3 main principles of anonymity, simplicity and readability. Together, we aim to start many new conversations and build new relationships among users across college campuses, starting here at RPI. 

Tech Stack:

The first version of this app will be created with the intention of being used on a PC. The future goal would be to make this a mobile application in order to appeal to a larger variety of college students. We are not sure at this time whether we will use an AMP stack or a MEAN stack. 

Application Features:

Geolocation

The web application would utilize geolocation in finding nearby colleges in the user’s current area. The user will be allowed to select their college from the list of universities in the area within a set radius. This feature allows for users to only see the feed of the institution that they attend.

Post Categories (Tags)

The Anonymous Chat web application would have an initial page that users are brought to where they have the option to filter the posts by specific categories. Once the categories have been selected, the page will display the relevant posts sorted by popularity. The post tag feature would allow for less cluttering of the user’s main feed, and the ability for users to discriminate which posts they would like to see at a given time.
Possible tags: Sports, Events, News, General, Random, Clubs, Funny, etc.

Moderating

Posts expire after a week, or a time selected at post creation.
Posts that have received a significant number of downvotes will be automatically removed from users timelines in order to decrease the chance of offensive/hateful content being shown. 
Users that have had multiple posts removed will be subject to a temporary or permanent ban or from creating future posts. 
Posts that have been inactive for more than a week will be archived. Users can view the post again if they’ve favorited the thread post. 
Users that create a post are also given the option of “archiving” the thread before one week of inactivity. 

Sort by Popularity and Time

Users will have the option to sort messages by the most upvoted and also by the most recent. It is important to give the option to sort by most recent so that posts will have the chance to be upvoted.
